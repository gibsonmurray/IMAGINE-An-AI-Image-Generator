APP DESCRIPTION:
    This app uses OPENAI's DALL-E 2 and MongoDB to have a user login and generate images from their own ‚ú®imagination‚ú®.
    Cookies are involved so make sure those are enabled. The passwords are hashed but I don't recommend putting anything
    that you normally use. The responsiveness is iffy but there is only so much I can do in a short time.
    If you generate too many images it will hit the limit on the OPENAI billing trial so use it sparingly. 
    Don't choose a bad username...Enjoy! üòÅ
